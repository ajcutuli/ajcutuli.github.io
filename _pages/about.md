**Hello!**
---
My name is Aric. I'm currently a Masters student of Financial Engineering at Columbia University, where I concentrate in machine learning. At the Center for Climate Systems Research, I am conducting research on probabilistic models of human migration flows under the supervision of [Dr. Upmanu Lall](http://www.columbia.edu/~ula2/) and [Dr. Michael J. Puma](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/michael-joseph-puma).

Broadly speaking, I'm interested in the application and advancement of quantitative and computational methods to make better decisions in uncertain environments. In this regard, I find Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, stochastic control, information theory, and their intersections to be philosophically attractive. Domains of practical interest to me are complex adaptive systems that evolve through agents' decisions, such as markets and social networks.

In addition to research, I spent the past two summers interning as a quantitative analyst at Citigroup. This summer, I rotated on the Equities Central Risk desk, where my focus was on improving a portion of their systematic order filtering system. In 2022, I worked in the AI Innovation Lab and helped fine-tune Google's BERT language model to denoise information-rich news streams through classification.

Here is my full [CV](/files/Aric_Cutuli_CV.pdf).
