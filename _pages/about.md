**Hello!**
---
My name is Aric. I'm currently a Masters student of Financial Engineering at Columbia University, where I concentrate in machine learning. At the Center for Climate Systems Research, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Upmanu Lall](http://www.columbia.edu/~ula2/) and [Dr. Michael J. Puma](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/michael-joseph-puma) on using Bayesian methods to model human migration flows and shed light onto the various push and pull factors that influence migration decisions.

My background is quite multidisciplinary. Financial engineering is a combination of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and financial theory, and as an undergraduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, I majored in Mathematics and Economics and earned a Specialization in Computing for additional computer science oriented coursework I pursued.

I spent the past two summers interning as a quantitative analyst at Citigroup Global Markets. This summer, I rotated on the Equities Central Risk desk, where my focus was on improving a portion of their systematic order filtering system. In 2022, I worked in the AI Innovation Lab and helped fine-tune Google's BERT language model to classify news alerts in the context of commodities markets.

Here is my full [CV](/files/Aric_Cutuli_CV.pdf).
