The prediction of migration flows, or the number of individuals who will migrate from one location to another, is a fundamental goal of research on population dynamics. Traditional approaches for modeling migration flow include physics-inspired models such as the gravity model and the radiation model. In their simplest form, these models represent migration flow as functions of the relative attractiveness of a locale using a few socio-economic features as proxies. Furthermore, they assume that the parameters governing the relationship between features and migration flow are spatially invariant, regardless of the origin and destination locations of migrants. We argue that this is a limitation of the classical models and formulate Bayesian hierarchical models to capture variation in regression coefficients according to origin-destination pair. Through an application to interstate migration data from the United States, we demonstrate that simply by admitting heterogeneity in a latent migration parameter, a large amount of variation in migrant flows can be explained. Such heterogeneities may be due to factors that were not considered. We also showcase the hierarchical approach's ability to outperform the classical methods as well as some recent machine learning approaches. The spatially-varying parameters can also be clustered to elicit insights about the heterogeneity of migrants' preferences with respect to socio-economic features that are not accounted for by the model. According to a clustering analysis of spatially-varying parameters, individuals migrating along low-flow paths appear to give less priority to destination characteristics in their migration decision than individuals migrating along high-flow paths.

Current models of human mobility rely on static models inferred using multivariate regression that do not explicitly model the temporal structure of the data. We propose a new approach using non-homogeneous hidden Markov models (NHMMs) to reveal underlying space-time patterns in human migration  that  are not directly observable, but whose persistence and likelihood of occurrence may be identified by exogenous drivers. These drivers may include the migration predictors used in traditional models. We develop NHMMs for state-to-state migrations in the United States using data from 2005 to 2019. We test the performance of these models using out-of-sample forecasts and compare those to  selected traditional and newer machine learning models.We find that climate disasters emerge as important drivers of migration in the United-States. The NHMM model outperforms traditional human migration models, as well as some recent deep learning approaches for multivariate time series forecasting. The NHMMs provide insights into the hidden patterns driving complex migrations, while delivering superior forecasting performance compared to both linear and nonlinear approaches.
