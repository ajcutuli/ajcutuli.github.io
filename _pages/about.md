**Hello!**
---
My name is Aric. I am soon to graduate from Columbia University with a MS in Financial Engineering. At the Center for Climate Systems Research, I am conducting research on probabilistic models of human migration flows under the supervision of [Dr. Upmanu Lall](http://www.columbia.edu/~ula2/) and [Dr. Michael J. Puma](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/michael-joseph-puma).

My research interests intersect uncertainty quantification, reinforcement learning, stochastic control, mathematical finance, game theory, and decision theory.

In addition to research, I spent the past two summers interning as a quantitative analyst at Citigroup. This summer, I rotated on the Equities Central Risk desk, where my focus was on improving a portion of their systematic order filtering system. In 2022, I worked in the AI Innovation Lab and helped fine-tune Google's BERT language model to denoise information-rich news streams through classification.

Here is my full [CV](/files/Cutuli_CV.pdf).
