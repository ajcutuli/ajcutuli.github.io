<!-- ## About
I'm currently employed as a systematic trader and researcher of securitized products. Previously, as a graduate student at Columbia University, I researched Bayesian inference and population dynamics under the supervision of [Upmanu Lall](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4823918) and [Michael J. Puma](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/users/profile/michael-joseph-puma). As an undergraduate at UCLA, I studied advances in machine learning for market microstrure under the mentorship of [Moritz Voss](https://sites.google.com/view/moritzvoss). -->
