**Hello there!**

I'm studying Applied Statistics & Data Science at **Columbia University** (M.A. in QMSS). I have a background in **Applied Mathematics** and Financial Economics (I'm also currently pursuing a B.S. in Mathematics at Sorbonne Universit√©).



**Academic Interests**

The more I study, the less I know...

Right now: applications of deep learning to image & sound, and pure mathematics


**General Interests**
---

Arthouse Cinema, Jazz Guitar, Indie Music, Running, Modern American Literature, Anime & Manga _+ whatever Kevin Feige is cooking with the MCU_
