### Getting inside the black box of vanilla convex Optimization

for many applied data scientists, optimization is still a black box that is the magic used when calling some fitting routine

'''
model = Model()
model.fit(optimizer='gradient_descent')

'''

I will explain two very common descent methods for unconstrained optimization and implement them in python from scratch

### Descent methods, the general principle

Descent methods consist of looki

### Gradient Descent
