### Getting inside the black box of vanilla convex Optimization

for many applied data scientists, otpimization is still a black box that is the magic used when calling some fitting routine
'''
model = Model()
model.fit(optimizer='gradient_descent')

'''

I will explained two very common descent methods for unconstrained optimization and implement them in python from scratch



### Gradient Descent
